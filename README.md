# HELLO

## My name is Sal Jimenez and I am a computer engineering undergrad, DreamUS Scholar, SHPE & IEEE Memeber, and an ambitious learner. 

## My background is centered around where Hardware and Software intertwine. Operating Systems, Machine Learning, and Computer architecture are what really interest me.

## Some of my past and current projects are:

- **3D printed Augmented Reality Headset**
   I helped in spearheading the design, research, integration, testing and troubleshooting for this project. I led a team of software and electrical engineers to construct an AR headset capable of object detection for helping elderly in assisted driving. We placed 4th our of 40 teams for this engineering hackathon. (Thank you IIT & Grainger for this opportunity!)
Here are some pictures

- **GradPath AI (Recommender System/Chatbot for classes)**
  Developed an AI-driven recommendation system, leveraging course grade data and historical student records, to tackle uninformed course choices and improve graduation rates. Personalized course recommendations were generated, enhancing efficiency, and aligning with each student's goals.
	Incorporating two data frames, GRADPATH AI applies classification Machine Learning techniques to forecast student letter grades, a categorical variable, through predictive modeling. Approach involves presenting input data to a machine learning model to determine corresponding categories, defining a key aspect of classification machine learning.

Ill provide a youtube video link of this project right here: [GradPath AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZVAXxrdJU&t=3s)

- Built out a Convolution Neural Network from complete scratch in JAVA. No neural network libraries where utilized, only Math and ArrayLists :).
  Used the MNIST training & Testing data set for testing. **(I got it to reach about %91 accuracy on the guesses)**

## My background:
- **I'm passionate about the industry _trends_ going on in the world of engineering.**
  
- My educational background is a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology in the Windy City. Im also a humble Morton College Alumni (MC STATE!!!) 
  
- Former CEO/Consultant of Polarizer Video Studios:
      Created video ads for dental and local businesses. Outsources services to 3d party vendors to meet client demands. Onboarded clients onto our platforms.
  
- FormerIIT-IEEE Social Media Exec Board: Here is our instagram: [IIT-IEEE](https://www.instagram.com/iit.ieee/)

Outside of science, Im very passionate in the sweet science (boxing), not only that I also am heavily investing in leading both by example and guiding my younger brother, Aaron, LinkedIn: through his undergrad journey since he too is also looking to study computer science / electrical engineering. I am also and avid reader and am heavily investing in my SHPE chapter at my school.
